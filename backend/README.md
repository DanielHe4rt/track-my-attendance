# Track My Attendance â€” Backend

This is the backend server for the **Track My Attendance** project, built with Python and FastAPI. It handles all the API requests, authentication, and database interactions.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependencies and environment management.

## Local Development

* Start the local server

```sh
poetry run task run
```

Now you can open your browser and interact with these URLs:

* Backend server: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
* Interactive documentation with Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
* Alternatively, you can use the ReDoc documentation at [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### Additional details

By default, the dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can go there and install it.

In the `./backend` directory, you can install all dependencies with:

```sh
poetry install
```

Then you can start the virtual environment with:

```sh
poetry shell
```

## Development Tools

This project uses [Taskipy](https://github.com/taskipy/taskipy) to provide tools that help the development workflow.

The available tools are:

* Run lint

```sh
poetry run task lint
```

* Run format
```sh
poetry run task format
```

> Both linter and formatter as powered by [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff).

* Run tests
```sh
poetry run task test
```

> When the tests are run, a file `htmlcov/index.html` is generated, you can open it in your browser to see the coverage of the tests.

* Run development server locally
```sh
poetry run task run
```

> After this, you'll be able to open the URL [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000) and the interactive documentation with the URL [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
